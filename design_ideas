teacher can create course
student can learn course

teacher and student role

when logging in with user & password, the system needs to know,
if that's a student or teacher



2model student and teacher, inheriting user
what about the schema ??

i will group then as only users/ but with different policy for them



- add course limit (checking number)


index the student and teacher differently
// make use of caching so that sorting / displaying becomes faster

//seed to test front


assign all the stuff about courses to /courses
there will be no /user/courses
if a user wants to see all the course that he has registered, he will go to /courses 

in /courses will have a view that will retrieve all the users course, the market place ....


if one material's gonna have one and just one file,
why do we even need a file entity in the first place ??

okay let's drop the file entity
